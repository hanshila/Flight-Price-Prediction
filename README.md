# Flight-Price-Prediction
This is the project based on flight price prediction using regression models.


#Intro/Objective

Nowadays, the number of people using flights has increased significantly. It is difficult for airlines to maintain prices since prices change dynamically due to different conditions. Thatâ€™s why we try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain. It can also help customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journey


#Methods Used

Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning
Feature Engineering
Machine Learning
Data Visualization
Predictive Modeling
etc.


#Project Description

This project is about Predicting Flight Prices using Regression techniques to find Mean Absolute Error, Mean squared Error, Root mean Squared Error and r2 score. I have used Lasso regressor for Feature Selection and XGB regressor to fit the model and do predictions.
In this project, Data Preprocessing and data cleaning is a major challenge. The visualization plots helped in checking assumptions for Regression Technique.
