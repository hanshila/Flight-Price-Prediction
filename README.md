# Flight-Price-Prediction
This is the project based on flight price prediction using regression models.
#Intro/Objective
Nowadays, the number of people using flights has increased significantly. It is difficult for airlines to maintain prices since prices change dynamically due to different conditions. Thatâ€™s why we try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain. It can also help customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journey
